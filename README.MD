# ClearView - Tackling Dehazing Challenges

### Authors : Rohit Shrothrium (rs8031), Savinay Shukla (ss16924)

Lightweight De-Hazification model with 1800 trainable params and 8MiB in size.

Our approach employs depth-wise separable convolutional layers and self-regularized activation functions to effectively clean hazy images and can be integrated with segmentation models for enhanced performance. We believe that our approach will be particularly useful for memory-
bound systems already confined by heavy segmentation models when dealing with obscured environments. Our benchmark results based on SSIM and PSNR scores demonstrate that our modified architecture achieves performance on par with the DehazeNet model while having a smaller overall memory footprint. This makes our approach a promising solution for memory-bound autonomous systems that use computer vision in obscured environments, as it offers efficient and effective dehazing capabilities with reduced computational requirements.

Download the dataset and extract in the project’s directory, before running the experiment. This will create a data folder.

>Note: The folder structure is as follows
```
CLEAR_VIEW (Project root dir)
    |
    |
    ---- data
    |        |
    |        |---haze (Hazy images set)
    |        |
    |        |
    |        |---original (Original images set)
    |
    |----(rest of your project files)
```

1. `driver.py` is the start point of execution
2. It takes in multiple args
```
python3 driver.py \
    --og_img=data/original/ \
    --hazy_img=data/haze/ \
    --lr=0.0004 \
    --weight_decay=0.0001 \
    --grad_clip_norm=0.1 \
    --num_epochs=10 \
    --train_batch=8 \
    --val_batch=8 \
    --num_workers=4 \
    --snapshots_folder=snapshots/ \
    --model=clearview \
    --run_id=clearview \
    --logs=logs/
```
3. Inorder to run "clearview" model use option `--model=clearview` else `--model=dehaze` for DehazeNet
4. Use `examples.ipynb` to visualize various results

>Note: The training process outputs `Run logs in logs folder` and the model- `clearview.pth` in snapshots folder.

# Analysis

Due to reduced complexity of our implementation (using depth-wise convolutional layers) we were able to achieve faster training times when compared to the Dehazenet architecture.

Additionally, our PSNR and SSIM scores are on par with the Dehazenet scores.
